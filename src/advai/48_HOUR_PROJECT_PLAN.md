## **EXECUTION STRATEGY**

### **Overnight Runs** (11 PM - 7 AM): 
- **Focus**: Longest, most compute-intensive experimental conditions
- **Target**: All 28 experimental conditions with large case counts (50-100 per condition)
- **Total Cases**: 1,400 to 2,800+ cases
- **Advantage**: Maximize compute during sleep hours

### **Active Hours** (7 AM - 11 PM):
- **Focus**: Analysis, interpretation, documentation
- **Tasks**: Process overnight results, statistical analysis, report generation
- **Advantage**: Human oversight for complex analysis tasks

---

## **EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS** (28 Total)

### **Prompt Variations** (4 base conditions):
1. **Baseline**: No demographic info, no clamping
2. **Demographic Prompts**: Include age/sex in prompts, no clamping  
3. **Clamping Only**: No demographic prompts, apply clamping
4. **Both**: Demographic prompts + clamping

### **Clamping Variations** (24 conditions):
- **Demographics**: Male, Female, Old, Young, Old+Male, Old+Female, Young+Male, Young+Female (8 groups)
- **Intensities**: 1x, 5x, 10x (3 levels)
- **Total**: 8 √ó 3 = 24 clamping conditions

---**Total Experimental Conditions**: 4 prompt + 24 clamping = 28 conditions

- **Use CPU device for consistency** (`--device cpu`)
- **Run with sufficient cases** (50-100 minimum for statistical power)
- **Monitor disk space** (28 conditions √ó large datasets = significant storage)
- **Backup results frequently**

### Expected Outcomes:
- Quantitative bias measurements across all demographic features
- Comparison of prompt-level vs internal clamping effects
- Optimal clamping intensities for bias detection
- Statistical significance of demographic bias
- Reproducible experimental framework

### Risk Mitigation:
- Start long runs early to account for failures
- Create checkpointing for partial results
- Have backup analysis methods ready
- Prepare manual intervention procedures

This plan maximizes your 48-hour window while respecting your sleep schedule and ensuring the most computationally intensive work runs overnight.
